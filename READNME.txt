I downloaded the source of python from the link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/Python-2.7.13.tgz
unzipped  the zip file and compiled the .configur file inside using the commands
./configure 
--prefix=/usr  
--enable-shared               
--with-system-expat             
--with-system-ffi               
--with-ensurepip=yes             
--enable-unicode=ucs4 && make
which i found using my google
and running  those commands python copy was successfully installed
